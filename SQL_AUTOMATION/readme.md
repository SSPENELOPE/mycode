# SQL Automation Task's

# What is this?
- This is my best attempt at using some python libraries to streamline the process of generating data based up tables and columns in a database. 
- For the most part, you will be prompted to select a table from your DB, followed by a column. A PDF with a data summary and 2 charts should be output to the reports directory with a timestamp being that they all go to the same folder.

# Credits
- Mr. Chad Feeser for letting me build this and push myself a little further

# Known issues
- Is the pdf perfect? Nah, I had to learn a lot while I made this. I would love to have made this elaborate PDF file with data visualization, however being that I had a lot of learning to do, it was more proof of concept
- There is tons of un-accounted for edge cases that I am sure you will find if you play with it for long enough
